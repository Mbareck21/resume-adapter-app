# Resume Adapter AI System Patterns

## System Architecture

Resume Adapter AI follows a modern web application architecture with clean separation of concerns:

1. **Frontend Layer** 
   - Single Page Application (SPA) built with React 19 and Next.js 15 
   - Client-side state management with React hooks and Context API
   - Responsive UI components built with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI

2. **API Layer**
   - Next.js API routes implementing serverless functions
   - Handles document processing, AI integration, and file generation
   - Stateless design for scalability

3. **AI Integration Layer**
   - Interfaces with Google's Generative AI SDK
   - Manages prompt engineering and response handling
   - Implements safety measures and error handling

4. **Document Processing Layer**
   - Handles input parsing and normalization
   - Generates output documents in various formats
   - Ensures proper formatting and styling

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Next.js Framework**
   - Provides integrated solution for frontend and API routes
   - Serverless deployment on Vercel
   - Modern React features with App Router

2. **Google Gemini AI**
   - Selected for its strong natural language capabilities
   - Using gemini-1.5-flash-latest model for optimal performance
   - Configured with appropriate safety settings

3. **Document Generation Approach**
   - PDF: Using @react-pdf/renderer for consistent styling
   - DOCX: Using docx library for Word document generation
   - Markdown as intermediate format for content

4. **UI Component Strategy**
   - Shadcn UI for accessible, customizable components
   - Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
   - Custom components where needed for specific functionality

5. **State Management**
   - React Context API with hooks for simpler state needs
   - Potential to adopt Zustand if complexity increases
   - Form state managed with React Hook Form

## Design Patterns

1. **Component Composition Pattern**
   - UI built from small, reusable components
   - Props for configuration and customization
   - Container/presentation component separation

2. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - AI and document processing logic encapsulated in service modules
   - Clean interfaces for maintainability and testing
   - Business logic separated from UI concerns

3. **API Facade Pattern**
   - Simple API endpoints that orchestrate complex operations
   - Consistent error handling and response structure
   - Input validation before processing

4. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Core functionality works with minimal JavaScript
   - Enhanced features for modern browsers
   - Graceful degradation where necessary

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
   - Fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
   - Optimized interactions for various devices

## Component Relationships

1. **User Input Flow**
   ```
   UploadForm → ResumeInput → JobDescriptionInput → AdaptButton
   ```
   - Collects user inputs with appropriate validation
   - Manages file handling and text extraction
   - Triggers adaptation process

2. **Processing Flow**
   ```
   AdaptationService → AI Integration → AIResponseProcessor → ContentFormatter
   ```
   - Prepares inputs for AI processing
   - Handles API communication
   - Processes and formats AI responses

3. **Output Flow**
   ```
   AdaptedResumeDisplay → ResumeComparison → ExportOptions → DocumentGenerator
   ```
   - Displays the adapted resume with formatting
   - Provides comparison with original
   - Offers export options in various formats

4. **State Management**
   ```
   AppContext → useResumeState → Component-specific state
   ```
   - Centralized application state where needed
   - Component-specific state for local concerns
   - Form state managed separately for optimization

## Extensibility Points

1. **Template System**
   - Designed to support multiple resume templates
   - Clear separation between content and presentation
   - Configurable styling options

2. **AI Configuration**
   - Modular prompt engineering for future enhancements
   - Abstracted AI service for potential model switching
   - Configurable parameters for adaptation style

3. **Export Formats**
   - Pluggable document generation architecture
   - Common interface for adding new export formats
   - Separation between content and format conversion

4. **User Authentication** (Future)
   - Prepared hooks and context providers for auth state
   - Modular design allows for future account features
   - API routes designed with authentication in mind
