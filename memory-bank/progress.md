## Current Status

The project is in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) phase with core functionality implemented. The application can process resumes and job descriptions, generate adapted content using AI, and provide downloads in common formats. The UI is functional and styled according to modern design principles.

### Development Progress: ~60%

- **Core Functionality**: 90% complete
- **UI Implementation**: 80% complete
- **Document Generation**: 60% complete
- **Error Handling**: 40% complete
- **Advanced Features**: 0% (planned for future phases)

### Next Immediate Tasks:

1. Fix Markdown parsing in DOCX generation
2. Improve PDF styling and layout
3. Enhance error handling for AI processing
4. Add more detailed loading states
5. Begin implementation of DOCX/PDF upload support

## Known Issues

1. **Document Generation**:
   - DOCX output does not properly format Markdown (headings, lists, bold/italic)
   - PDF styling needs improvement for better visual presentation
   - Inconsistent handling of special characters in generated documents

2. **UI Issues**:
   - Loading feedback during AI processing is minimal
   - No progress indication during file uploads
   - Limited error messaging for failed operations
   - Some responsive design issues on smaller screens

3. **AI Processing**:
   - Occasional inconsistent formatting in AI responses
   - Long processing times for larger resumes/job descriptions
   - No fallback for AI service disruptions
   - Limited handling of content safety rejections

4. **Input Handling**:
   - Only supports .txt files for resume upload
   - No validation for resume content structure
   - No guidance on optimal job description format

5. **Performance**:
   - Potential client-side performance issues with large documents
   - No streaming implementation for progressive UI updates
   - Complete page re-renders in some situations where partial updates would suffice
