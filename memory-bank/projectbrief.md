# Resume Adapter AI Project Brief

## Project Vision

Resume Adapter AI is an intelligent web application that leverages Google's Gemini AI to help job seekers tailor their resumes to specific job descriptions. The platform analyzes both the user's existing resume and the target job description, then generates an optimized version that highlights relevant skills and experiences, increasing the chances of passing through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and catching the attention of hiring managers.

## Core Objectives

1. **Simplify Resume Tailoring**: Automate the time-consuming process of customizing resumes for specific job applications.
2. **Improve Application Success**: Help users create more effective, job-specific resumes that have a higher chance of passing ATS systems and impressing hiring managers.
3. **Maintain Professional Quality**: Ensure that AI-adapted resumes maintain a professional tone and accurate representation of the user's qualifications.
4. **User-Friendly Experience**: Create an intuitive interface that makes the adaptation process straightforward for all users.
5. **Professional Output**: Generate well-formatted, downloadable documents that users can submit directly with their applications.

## Target Audience

- **Job Seekers**: Individuals applying for jobs who want to maximize their chances of getting interviews.
- **Career Changers**: Professionals transitioning to new industries who need to emphasize transferable skills.
- **Recent Graduates**: Students with limited experience who need help positioning their skills effectively.
